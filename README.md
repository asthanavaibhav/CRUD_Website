# CRUD_Website
This is a simple yet functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript. Users can add, view, edit, and delete records dynamically. The UI is responsive and modern, ensuring a smooth user experience. Future plans include backend integration with Firebase or another database.
